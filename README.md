Introduction
Employee Attrition Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at identifying the likelihood of an employee leaving the company. By applying predictive analytics, we can uncover patterns and factors that lead to employee turnover and assist HR departments in taking actionable steps to improve retention.

Problem Statement
High turnover rates can have a negative impact on a company's morale, productivity, and finances. This project seeks to address the following questions:

What features are most indicative of a high risk of attrition?
Can we predict the probability of an employee leaving within the next time period?
How can we leverage this model to inform HR policies and retention strategies?
Data
The dataset used in this project is synthetic, generated to resemble real-world HR data while preserving individual privacy.

Dataset Features
EmployeeID: Unique identifier for employees
Age: Age of the employee
Department: The department in which the employee works
JobRole: Role of the employee within the department
MaritalStatus: Marital status of the employee
OverTime: Whether the employee works overtime
JobLevel: Level of the employee in the company hierarchy
Attrition: Whether the employee left the company (Target Variable)
Data Preprocessing
We've handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized the dataset for training. Details are in the preprocess.py script.

Features
The following features are engineered to train the model:

Numerical features such as 'MonthlyIncome' and 'TotalWorkingYears'
Categorical features like 'JobRole' and 'MaritalStatus'
Binary features such as 'OverTime'
Modeling
We use various machine learning algorithms to train our predictive model:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines
Model selection and evaluation are based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:
git clone https://github.com/your-Godwino/employee-attrition-prediction.git
